## More About Me

Hello! I'm Paule Macedo, a passionate Cybersecurity Enthusiast and Software Developer. I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at CEFET/RJ, where I am honing my skills and knowledge in various domains of technology.

My journey in the tech world began with a fascination for how things work behind the scenes, which naturally led me to explore the realms of Linux, Networking, and Cybersecurity. I am constantly learning and expanding my expertise in these areas, driven by a curiosity to understand and secure digital environments.

In addition to my technical pursuits, I have a creative side that I express through design and multimedia projects. I enjoy working with tools like Figma, GIMP, and DaVinci Resolve to bring my ideas to life.

I am actively seeking internship opportunities in Cybersecurity to apply my skills in real-world scenarios and contribute to meaningful projects. If you have any opportunities or would like to connect, feel free to reach out to me via email or LinkedIn.

Thank you for visiting my profile, and I look forward to connecting with you!
